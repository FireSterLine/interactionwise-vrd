    \citebyaut{prior-softmax}). % namely, the semantic embedding of the objects
    % is computed using a pre-trained Word2Vec model, and a a different, independent,
    % linear projection of the combined subject-object embeddings for every predicate.

Ideas to save cleaner results:
- One thing we can do is to get rid of the txts (until a few days ago, I was not producing csvs, now I'm producing both but we don't really need both anymore, we can just continue with csvs, more easily manageable when pasting and copying and displaying etc.))
- Add the count for each predicate
- For each epoch add more than one line (by predicate recalls scores can be stacked vertically instead of horizontally)

WRITING:
- Class Semantic Awareness for Visual Relationship Detection

Abstract
- It would be nice to add as last sentence your achievement. Eg. we improved the existing model by decreasing the error by 4%.
- And then, either: in this work we find that we can leverage word embeddings for the purpose; or we clearly state the hypothesis: can we leverage word embeddings for this

Introduction
- maybe the problems should be under the introduction ?
- mention the current problem/performance of the existing model which you try to improve, and why do you believe that it may profit from something else
- Avoid we and our
- add real world applications examples

Datasets
- EXPAND

Multi-modality:
- first paragraph is huuuuge --> keep balance

Methods
- the results should show the results obtained with models described in methods
- explain the blind model

Discussion
- Make points about results, re-establish the research, show the limitations, future research and recommendation

Results
- We're going to use R@50 and R@30 because the values were quite high already.
- ...So we believe that the metrics are weak in this sense. In fact, this may be a side offect of using ``softened metrics'' (see section...)
- When showing the results per-predicate, signal that:
