scan-v6

Let the mode be the last value in the name of the scan files.
mode = [1 2   9 10   17 18 19 25 29 33]

Here's an explanation of the mode value,
  together with some comments on the results of the scan:

- [1,2,9,10] uses a SemSim layer, coupled with either one or two fc layers, and with or without logit
  - [1,  2] : FC 512 -> FC 300 -> SemSim
  - [9, 10] : FC 300 -> SemSim
  - [1,  9] : Logit applied after cosine similarity
  comment: A unique FC layer is better than two FCs.
           Interestingly, applying the logit messes up relationship detection (all 4 scores go between 0-1%),
            although it improves Pre R@100 (zs and non-zs) by 5-10 perc. points.
- [17 to 33] Simply uses the pred2pred semantic (cosine) similarities to re-score the predicates scores (matrix multiplication)
  - 17, the simplest version of these:
    - doesn't normalize the rows of the pred2pred matrix
    - doesn't use relu before the last layer
    - doesn't use the bias in the last layer
    - trains the last layer
    - uses a unique FC before the re-scoring layer
  - 18 normalizes the rows of the pred2pred matrix
  - 19 uses relu before the last layer
  comment: 18 and 19 don't improve 17
  - 25 fixes the last layer
  - 29 fixes the last layer using the biases (fixed at random value).
  comment: 25 and 29 are 5% worse than 17. TODO: try using the biases without fixing the last layer (21)
  - 33 uses two FCs before the re-scoring layer
  comment: this does slightly worse than 17
comment: just below no-pred-sem, 17 is the best choice of these.
