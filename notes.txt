New idea:
 look for "Letâ€™s build a proper (yet simple" here: https://towardsdatascience.com/understanding-pytorch-with-an-example-a-step-by-step-tutorial-81fc5f8c4e8e
 They have single paramters. Well, implement the linear projection for a predicate there. Beforee that, check if it's already there somewhere int he code.
 They claim it is, in the paper.


Before batching:

CLS PRED TEST:
All:	R@50:  90.698	R@100:  95.349
ZShot:	R@50:  85.714	R@100:  100.000
TEST Time: 00:00:26
	   0: LOSS:  0.411
	   1: LOSS:  0.038
	   2: LOSS:  0.771
	   3: LOSS:  0.162
	   4: LOSS:  0.066
TRAIN Loss:  0.290
TRAIN Time: 00:02:28

After introducing the "fake" 1-batching:

CLS PRED TEST:
All:	R@50:  90.698	R@100:  95.349
ZShot:	R@50:  85.714	R@100:  100.000
0: LOSS:  0.044
1: LOSS:  0.153
2: LOSS:  0.428
3: LOSS:  0.066
4: LOSS:  0.681
TRAIN Loss:  0.275
