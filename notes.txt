New idea:
 look for "Letâ€™s build a proper (yet simple" here: https://towardsdatascience.com/understanding-pytorch-with-an-example-a-step-by-step-tutorial-81fc5f8c4e8e
 They have single paramters. Well, implement the linear projection for a predicate there. Beforee that, check if it's already there somewhere int he code.
 They claim it is, in the paper.



 # TODO: check if shuffle works

num_workers>1
to(device outside datalayer)
pin_memory=True in dataloader
cache datalayer output to file and load like with torch.load('data/' + ID + '.pt')


 criterion = nn.CrossEntropyLoss()
 optimizer = optim.SGD(net.parameters(), lr=0.001, momentum=0.9)
